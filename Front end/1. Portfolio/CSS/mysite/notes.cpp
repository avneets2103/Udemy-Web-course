    //     span element: You can choose a speicifc part in the block element
    // -->
    // <!--
    //     ## Block elements: h1-h6, p, etc 
    //     They can be changed in size accordingly by our own will but still wont let anyone else come in their block area
        
    //     ## Inline element: span etc.
    //     They cant be modified but dont takes the full block area 
        
    //     For converting a block element to inline element we can use the display property of an element to inline and vice versa
    //     eg: display:inline;

    //     ## Inline-block element: You can both alter/ modify along with it, it dont also takes the full block size (best of both world): img etc.
    //     eg: display: block-inline;
        
    //     ## None block element: You can use display : none; which will almost delete tht element and the other elements are changed accordingly
    //     ## Visibility:hidden; This will just make visibility 0 but the space will still be left vancant

    //     Relative position:

    //     You are talking now in terms of the original position of the element, in 4 directions i.e. left margin, right margin, top margin, bottom margin.

    //     This wont effect any other element in the page and just the element we are working on.

    // <!-- 
    //     Absolute position:
    //     position: absolute;

    //     You are talking now in terms of the position of the parent element from the top of the parent, bottom of the parent, right of parent, left of parent.

    //     Parent isnt always the body but the nearest parent.
    // -->

    // <!-- 
    //     Fixed position:
    //     position:fixed;

    //     That element stays fixed at a place and dont moves a lil even on scrolling.
    //  -->

    // Float property of the element allows it to stay in the specific spot wrt anoyher element
    // float: left;

    // Clear is something like anti float, used for removing a specific part from wrapping around an element.
