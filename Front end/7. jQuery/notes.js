// jQuery: Its a library, framework to do the same stuff as in JS but with less code shit.

// Loading jQuery: (Using CDN)
// 1. Always add the CDN link of jQuery before your index.js script 
// 2. Never load the library in head section rather use the scripts always at the end of the body

// Element selector
// Now we use $ rather than document.querySelector or document.querySelectorAll
// When we are trying to select all our elements sharing the property mentioned, $ selects all of them
